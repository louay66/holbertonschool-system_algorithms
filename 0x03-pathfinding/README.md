# C - Pathfinding

## General

- What is pathfinding
- What are the most common applications of pathfinding
- What is backtracking, and why you should never use it
- What is Dijkstra’s algorithm, and what is its main weakness
- What is A star algorithm, and how it is better than Dijkstra’s

## Pathfinding project - Libraries

Two libraries are provided for the pathfinding project: `Graphs` and `Queues`.

Use the GCC options `-lgraphs` and `-lqueues` to link witht the two given libraries.

Refer to the header files `graphs.h` and `queues.h` for the documentation.
